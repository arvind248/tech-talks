# Making a Difference - Experiences of a 17 year-old in the Tech Scene

## Abstract

While most of you are having a full-time engineering job, I am still going to school, working part-time as a Software Consultant for TNG Technology Consulting and maintaining several popular projects. Everytime I talk at a meetup, people ask me how I achieved that and want to know how I got to do all this stuff, so in this talk, I will cover the challenges I have to face because of my age, reveal how doing Open Source changed my life and recount the most inspiring moments that proved me how great the tech community can be.

## Description

After Ali Splittel motivated me to do a talk about “my age”, I initially thought that there isn’t much to talk about. But however, it seems like many people are indeed interested in my personal career, how I got into programming and how I got to where I am right now, receiving job offers every day. In this talk, I will tell attendees about my background, how I got into programming and especially, my open source journey - from my first Pull Request in the Hacktoberfest to becoming an active contributor and maintainer. I will also share some of my most inspiring moments in the tech community. However, neither my professional nor my private life is a cinderella story, I will also reveal challenges like devoting enough time for school, making sacrifices in relationships, having to cancel conferences for both school and money reasons and the constant pressure of having to achieve something as well as repeatedly being underappreciated for ageism reasons.
