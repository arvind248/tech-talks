# Making a Difference - Experiences of a 17 year-old in the Tech Scene

## Abstract

While most of you are having a full-time engineering job, I am still going to school, working part-time as a Software Consultant for TNG Technology Consulting and maintaining several popular projects. Everytime I talk at a meetup, people ask me how I achieved that and want to know how I got to do all this stuff, so in this talk, I will cover the challenges I have to face because of my age, reveal how doing Open Source changed my life and recount the most inspiring moments that proved me how great the tech community can be.

## Description

After Ali Splittel motivated me to do a talk about "my age", I initially thought that there isn't much to talk about. But however, it seems like many people are indeed interested in my personal career, how I got into programming and how I got to where I am right now, receiving job offers every day. In this talk, I will tell attendees about my background, how I got into programming and especially, how I started contributing to Open Source and my involvement in Open Source - from my first Pull Request in the Hacktoberfest to becoming a core member of 30-seconds-of-code and a maintainer of the cosmos algorithm collection to making 30-seconds-of-interviews, contributing to React, Prettier and Materialize.CSS and now also maintaining react-perf-devtools, one of the most popular React Performance Tools out there.
